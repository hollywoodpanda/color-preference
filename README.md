# ColorPreference

Welcome to the Color Keeper project. This is an Angular SPA that stores prefered colors per person.

## How to Run It

1. First make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) with the version 20 installed. Install it otherwise.
If you use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), you just have to run `nvm i` from the terminal, in the root folder of the project - it will change to a Node20 version automatically.
2. Make sure you have `yarn` installed. Just run `npm i -g yarn` to install it.
3. Build the project with the `yarn` command.
4. Using the Node v20, run `yarn start` to run the webapp.
5. That's it. Just reach `http://localhost:4200` on your browser and have fun.
